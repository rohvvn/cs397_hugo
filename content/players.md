Here are some of my favorite Steelers. Want changes? Tell me your list and I’ll update this page.

How to add/replace photos:

- Put your images in `static/images/players/`.
- Use descriptive, lowercase filenames with dashes (e.g., `troy-polamalu.jpg`).
- Common formats: `.jpg`, `.png`, `.webp`.
- Add more photos and I’ll add them here.

All-time greats:

- Joe Greene — The cornerstone of the “Steel Curtain” and a culture-setter.
- Franco Harris — Power and grace; the Immaculate Reception icon.
- Terry Bradshaw — Four-time Super Bowl–winning quarterback of the 1970s dynasty.
- Jack Lambert — Ferocious linebacker and leader of a legendary defense.
